# Get_next_line

## Overview
The get_next_line project is a crucial project in the 42 curriculum that explores file I/O, memory management, and parsing. In this project, students are tasked with creating a function that reads text from a file descriptor (such as a file or standard input) one line at a time. This project offers hands-on experience with reading and managing file input efficiently.

## Description
### Reading Lines from File Descriptors
get_next_line focuses on reading text one line at a time from a file descriptor. Students will create a function that reads characters until a newline character is encountered, effectively extracting a single line of text from the input.

### Project Objectives
- Implement a `get_next_line` function that reads and returns one line of text from a file descriptor.
- Handle multiple file descriptors concurrently, allowing for interleaved reading from different sources.
- Manage dynamic memory allocation for reading and storing lines of text.
- Ensure efficient and reliable reading, handling edge cases and errors gracefully.

## Key Concepts
### File I/O
File input and output operations are central to this project. Students will gain experience in opening, reading from, and closing file descriptors using the C Standard Library.

### Memory Management
Dynamic memory allocation is a key component of `get_next_line`. Students will learn to allocate and deallocate memory as needed to store lines of text.

### Parsing
String parsing plays a critical role in this project. Students will parse characters to identify and extract complete lines of text.

## Challenges
The get_next_line project presents several challenges to students:
- Implementing a function that reads text one line at a time and manages memory efficiently.
- Handling multiple file descriptors concurrently and ensuring they don't interfere with each other.
- Properly managing memory allocation and freeing allocated memory to prevent leaks.
- Handling edge cases, such as reading from empty files or handling unexpected input.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing the get_next_line project, students will gain valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:
- File input and output operations in C.
- Dynamic memory allocation and management.
- String parsing and character manipulation.
- Error handling and managing edge cases in I/O operations.
- Debugging and testing for robustness and correctness.
